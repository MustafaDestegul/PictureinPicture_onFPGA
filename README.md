# PictureinPicture_onFPGA
In this project I create a source code to merge two different 720p cameras in picture in picture mode and show them in the screen.
 The video streams are created with Test pattern generator IPs  in PS, then driven by vdma to the HDMI. The project is implemented by using Vivado HLx and Xilinx SDK.
